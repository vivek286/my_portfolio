      <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
      <br/>
      <h3>As a teenager at school, I was the kid other students approached about issues with their phone or laptop. I was the go-to guy for fixing resolving any technical problems. 
<br/>
<br/>
Today, not much has changed. Iâ€™m still the first point of call for technical issues. The difference is I now also develop innovative software to solve the problems of real life. One of my most recent projects involved designing and rolling out a new piece of software to optimize the efficiency of slot bookings for certification exams. This contributed to a reduction in staff numbers and a 10% increase in bookings.
